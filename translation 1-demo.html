Thus, in the following demonstration, you will perceive that the<span class="style6"> lower </span>edge  (defined by the centripetal pattern) seems more close to the central fixation compared with the <span class="style6">upper</span> edge (defined by the centrifugal pattern), although these two edges are literally in the same horizontal position.

    <tr>
      <td><div align="justify">An interesting question is what will happen if we use two patterns moving in opposite directions to define the equiluminous kinetic edge. Can we still observe the perceived positional displacement just as what happens in Demonstration 1. Furthermore, if the perceived displacement does occur, which direction it follows? Surprisingly, in this Demonstration, if you keep staring at the red fixation point, what you will see is completely opposite to Demonstration 1, i.e. now the <span class="style6">upper</span> edge (defined by contracting translations) seems more close to the central fixation compared with the <span class="style6">lower</span> edge (defined by expanding translations). The direction inversion between Demonstrations 1 &amp; 2 suggests that a new mechanism needs to be introduced in order to account for the new type of perceived spatial displacement. Here, we suggest that this direction inversion effect is due to the anisotropy of sensitivities to motion directions, namely, a greater sensitivity to centripetal rather than to centrifugal motion in peripheral viewing of human observers, as shown by Raymond (1994).</div>

    <tr>
      <td><div align="justify">The below demonstration suggested that the factor of eccentricity was a critical necessity for the occurance of the new type of perceived spatial displacement. When the fixation point was aligned with both motion defined edges of the expanding and contraction patterns, i.e. a ¡®zero eccentricity¡¯ condition, no perceived edge displacement was observed. However, when the eccentricity increased, the observers can perceive a vivid edge displacement even when the edges between the expanding and contracting translations were physically aligned. Also, the magnitude of the edge displacement seemed to increase with the eccentricity of the fixation. These observations are consistent with the results of previous study (Raymond, 1994) that a ¡®centripetal bias¡¯ was absent in central fovea but present in peripheral viewing and increased with the eccentricity.

    <tr>
      <td><div align="justify">Another possible explantion to Demonstration 2 is that the edge displacement is simply due to the appearance of some motion signals presented within the far half-pattern and their directions determine the direction of the edge displacement. However, this Demonstration  ruled out this possibility by inserting a static dot patch with 2 degree width between the near and the far half-patterns, i.e. a ¡®static sandwich¡¯ condition. If the role of motion signals within the far half-pattern is exactly as suggested above, we will expect to continually perceive an edge displacement with a direction same as the elements of the far half-pattern, i.e. a direction consistent with Demonstration 2. However, here most observers perceived an edge displacement with the direction same as that in Demonstration 1 instead of Demonstration 2, suggesting that the presentation of motion signals within the far half-pattern is not enough to induce the edge displacement pattern of Demonstration 2. The near and the far half-patterns must be spatially close enough (very possibly to produce a motion processing imbalance) in order to produce an edge displacement with direction predicted by the ¡®centripetal bias¡¯.</div>
