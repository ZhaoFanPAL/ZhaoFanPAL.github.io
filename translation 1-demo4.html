        <p>Another possible explanation to  Demonstration 2 is that the edge displacement is simply due to the appearance  of motion signals presented within the far half-pattern and their  directions determine the direction of the edge displacement. However, this  Demonstration ruled out this possibility by introducing a strong ¡®speed  imbalance¡¯ into the expansion pattern, the speed of motion signals within the far half-pattern of the expansion was tripled, i.e. a ¡®speed imbalance (faster far half-pattern of expansion)¡¯ condition.  If the role of motion signals within the far half-pattern is exactly as  suggested above, we will expect to observe an edge displacement with the same  direction but a larger magnitude as that in Demonstration 2. The  reason is that we amplified the effect of the ¡®special role¡¯ of local motion  signals within the far half-pattern of the expanding pattern by tripling the  speed. However, here most observers perceived an edge displacement whose  direction is the same as that in Demonstration 1 instead of Demonstration 2, i.e. the <span class="style6">lower</span> edge (defined by expanding translations) seems more close to the central fixation compared with the <span class="style6">upper</span> edge (defined by contracting translations), which suggests that the presentation of motion signals within the far half-pattern  is not enough to induce the edge displacement pattern of Demonstration 2. A  mechanism of processing imbalance, operating in a similar way to the ¡®speed  imbalance¡¯ used here must be introduced to account for the edge displacement in  Demonstration 2 whose direction is predicted by the ¡®centripetal bias¡¯.</p>
