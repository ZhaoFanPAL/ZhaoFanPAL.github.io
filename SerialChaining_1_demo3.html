        <p><strong>This experiment has four  conditions. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Condition 1 (Chained):</strong><br />
          The instructions in the  beginning of a block will say ¡®Following Blocks are for the <strong><u>Chained Condition</u></strong>.<br />
  <img src="SerialChaining_1_demo3_clip_image002.jpg" alt="exp1" width="601" height="199" /><br />
          Within  ¡®Chained condition¡¯ block, each trial contains two tasks. The dual-task trial has two consecutive tasks: T1 (above figure, left panel) and T2  (above figure, right panel). Your task in T1 is to use <span class="style5"><u>Left-hand</u></span> to press either <span class="style4">¡®s¡¯</span> key or <span class="style4">¡®f¡¯</span> key, depending on in  which side of the display the ¡®single cue¡¯ appears (The cue is a short low-contrast  line segment, indicated in above figure). When you see the cue, make your  response as quickly as possible and try to remember in which side the cue  appears. For above case, the correct response for T1 is ¡®Right¡¯, e.g. 'f' key. </p>
        <p>In T2, you will find two cues,  a left cue and a right cue. Since T1 and T2 are chained together in this  condition, you will need use the result of T1 to select one of the two cues to  perform T2 task. Particularly, if the single cue in T1 appears in the left side  then select the left cue in the following T2 and use the <span class="style5"><u>Right-hand</u></span> to press either <span class="style4">¡®up¡¯ </span>key or <span class="style4">¡®down¡¯</span> key, depending on the location of <em>selected T2 cue</em>, i.e. pressing up button if the left cue in T2 is  located in the upper display and down button for the lower display. If the single  cue in T1 appears in the right side then select the right cue of T2 and respond  based on its location. For above case, the correct response for T2 is ¡®Down¡¯, e.g. 'down' key. </p>
        <p><strong>Condition 2 (Independent- Left):</strong><br />
          The instructions in the  beginning of a block will say ¡®Following Blocks are for the <strong><u>Left VisualField</u></strong>.</p>
        <p>All  the aspects in ¡®Left VF Condition¡¯ are the same as ¡®Chained Condition¡¯ except  that in this condition, you don¡¯t need remember the result of T1 and use it in  following T2 task. Instead, you simply select  the <strong><em>LEFT</em></strong> cue in T2 directly and perform T2 task based on its location. Thus, for above  case, the correct response for T1 is ¡®Right¡¯, e.g. 'f' key, and the correct response for T2  is ¡®Up¡¯, e.g. 'up' key.</p>
        <p><strong>Condition 3 (Independent- Right):</strong><br />
          The instructions in the  beginning of a block will say ¡®Following Blocks are for the <strong><u>Right VisualField</u></strong>.</p>
        <p>All  the aspects in ¡®Right VF Condition¡¯ are the same as ¡®Left VF Condition¡¯ except  that in this condition, you select the<strong><em> RIGHT</em></strong> cue in T2 directly and perform T2 task based on its location.  Thus, for above case, the correct response for T1 is ¡®Right¡¯, e.g. 'f' key, and the correct  response for T2 is ¡®Down¡¯, e.g. 'down' key.</p>
        <p><strong>Condition 4 (Single Task):</strong><br />
          The instructions in the  beginning of a block will say ¡®Following Blocks are for the <strong><u>Single Task</u></strong>.</p>
        <p>Within  ¡®Single Task¡¯ block, each trial contains only one task. The single-task trial only has T1 but no T2, its  stimuli and response are the same as T1 of the dual-task trial. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Pay Attention to Feedback</u></strong>: In the end of dual-task  trial, two dots will be provided as feedback. Left dot is for the accuracy of  T1 (green for correct, red for incorrect) and right dot for T2. If you give no  response, which is another type of incorrect response and should be voided, the  corresponding feedback dot will become yellow as a warning. In single-task  trial, the absence of a response to T2 will be awarded a green right dot  automatically since there is no T2 in single-task trial. However, if you accidentally press 'up' or 'down' key, the right side feedback point will become red. </p>

1 <strong><u>Keep Fixation</u></strong>: Please make sure to keep you fixation all the time.<br />
2 <strong><u>Keep Head  Still and Don¡¯t Blink Within A Trial</u></strong>: Especially  do not blink immediately after finishing T1 in single-task trial since this  trial is not yet finished at that point and will last for some time. Only blink when the  instruction on the display tells you to do so (when the display shows ¡®Blink period!!!¡¯ during the stage of the feedback).  <br />
3 <strong><u>Response  Order: T1 first then T2</u></strong>: You need follow the exact response order, i.e. respond to T1 first, then  to T2. <br />
4 <strong><u>Respond As Quickly As Possible</u></strong>: We will record both response times and error rates in each task, so  it is extremely important that you can respond both quickly and accurately in  each task.<br />
5 <strong><u>Do Not Delay Your Response of T1</u></strong>:  You should respond to T1 immediately after perceiving T1 stimulus since we need  record both reaction times of T1 and T2. Please do not delay your response to  T1 until you fully perceive the stimulus of T2 and give two responses in a  combined way. If you do so, a yellow dot will be presented on the centre of the  display, serving as a warning to this incorrect response mode.</p>
