        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Two types of motion-induced displacement of equiluminous kinetic contours were investigated. In line with Ramachandran and Anstis¡¯ finding (1990), the direction of the first type was the same as that of unidirectional drifting dots next to static pattern. The kinetic contour in the second type of displacement was defined by two patterns moving in opposite directions, with the displacement in the direction of motion of the dots in the more eccentric field, so that the location of a kinetic contour defined by an expanding pattern is perceived as more eccentric, and that defined by a contracting as less eccentric. Two explanations for this effect (that the displacement reflects a greater weight given to the more eccentric motion, or that the region containing centripetal motion expands perceptually into that containing centrifugal motion) were tested in a further experiment by varying the velocity of the more eccentric region. The results ruled out explanations which are purely based on ¡®special role of motion signals within the more eccentric field¡¯. Instead, a mechanism based on processing imbalance between motion signals of different directions must be introduced in order to account for the perceived spatial displacement of the second type of motion-defined contours. Further control experiment showed that the difference in perceived location was not due to differences in the discriminability of expanding and contracting patterns. Our finding provides new evidence for a bias towards centripetal motion in human vision (Raymond, 1994), and suggests that the direction of motion induced displacement of kinetic contour is not always in the direction of an adjacent moving pattern. <span class="style4"><em><strong>(Fan &amp; Harris, 2008, Vision Research)</strong></em>.</span></p>
