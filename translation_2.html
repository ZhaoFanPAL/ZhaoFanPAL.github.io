        <p align="justify">In a recent study (<a href="translation 1.html">Fan, Z., &amp; Harris, J. (2008). Perceived spatial displacement of motion-defined contours in peripheral vision. Vision Research, 48(28), 2793-2804</a>), we demonstrated that virtual contours defined by two regions of dots moving in opposite directions were displaced perceptually in the direction of motion of the dots in the more eccentric region when the contours were viewed in the right visual field. Here, we show that the magnitude and/or direction of these displacements varies in different quadrants of the visual field.  When contours were presented in the lower visual field, the direction of perceived contour displacement was consistent with that when both contours were presented in the right visual field. However, this illusory motion-induced spatial displacement disappears when both contours were presented in the upper visual field. Also, perceived contour displacement in the direction of the more eccentric dots was larger in the right than in the left visual field, perhaps because of a hemispheric asymmetry in attentional allocation. Quadrant-based analyses suggest that the pattern of results arises from opposite directions of perceived contour displacement in the upper left and lower right visual quadrants, which depend on the relative strengths of two effects: a greater sensitivity to centripetal motion, and an asymmetry in the allocation of spatial attention.<span class="style4"><em><strong>(Fan &amp; Harris, 2010, Vision Research)</strong></em>.</span></p>
